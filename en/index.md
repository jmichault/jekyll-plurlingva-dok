 _Jekyll-plurlingva_ is a skeleton for the creation of static multilingual websites based on jekyll.  
Its purpose is to remain light for simplicity.

Its most striking features:
 * drawing on two columns:
   * on the left, a retractable menu, with the choice of language, Google web search, and the menu of website.
   * on the right, the main content.
 * suitable for websites _Github Pages_ .
 * all possibilities of jekyll. The scripts
 * allow you to automatically translate pages into all the languages ​​of the site.
 * translations are managed by po files:
   * if you modify or add a paragraph on a page, only this one needs to be retranslated.
   * you can send this file to a human translator for correction.
 * Automatically translated texts are indicated by a section that offers the document in the languages ​​corrected by a person.
 * The translations use Esperanto as a pivotal language. This choice may seem strange at first glance, but it has several advantages:
   * it is a language with a simple grammar and without exception, it is therefore easier to manage with software translators. .
   * it is a very precise language, generating less ambiguity than English.
   * it is very easy to learn, whatever the language of the student.
