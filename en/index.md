 _Jekyll-plurlingva_ is a skeleton for the creation of multilingual static websites, based on jekyll.  
Its purpose is to keep it light and simple.

Its most striking features:

 * design on two columns:


   * left drop-down menu, with: the choice of language, Google search on the site and the menu of the site.


   * on the right the main content.


 * adapted to websites _Github Pages_ .


 * all possibilities of jekyll.


 * can be used to create a blog, or a simple website with just a menu on the left.


 * Scripts allow you to automatically translate the pages of your language into all the languages ​​of the website.


 * the translations are managed by po files:


   * if you edit or add a paragraph on a page, only that paragraph needs to be retranslated.


   * you can send this file to a human translator for correction.


 * Automatically translated texts are indicated by a section that offers the document in the human-corrected languages.


 * The translations use Esperanto as a pivotal language. This choice may seem strange at first glance, but it has several advantages:


   * it is a language with a simple grammar and no exceptions, so it is easier to manage for software translators. .


   * it is a very precise language, generating less ambiguity than English.


   * it is very easy to learn, whatever the language of the learner.
